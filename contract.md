# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Wednesday from 6-8 PM. We will meet virtually using Zoom. One person in the group will take notes each week and this role will rotate weekly.

2. **Assistance** We expect each team member to be available on Discord to contact if anyone has questions about the project. Each teammate should be expected to respond within 1 day.

3. **Respect** At each meeting, we will have each person share what they accomplished and what their next steps are for what they have been assigned to implement. Everyone will be encouraged and allowed to share their ideas, and we will use majority votes to determine the direction of any suggestions made by individual team members. It is not required that everyone contributes a new idea each week, but it is required that each member listens to any suggestions made.

## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution** We will assign the workload for this project by asking each team member what they are comfortable working on and what they would like to implement. If unexpected complications arise where a significantly higher amount of work falls on the responsibility of any one teammate, we will discuss how we can redistribute that work among members of the team. 


2. **Time Commitment** We expect each member to work a minimum of 2 hours per week on the project. If a member finds they are spending longer than 4-5 hours on a their assigned deliverable, they can receive help and redistribute the remaining part of that work with another member on the team. Members are encouraged to work together in live discord calls to discuss their code or any questions that they have while working on the project. If someone is not contributing at all or very little, we will ask them to discuss their circumstances and reach out to staff members if needed.


3. **Conflict Resolution** If there is a disagreement between members, the associated members will discuss their disagreements online or offline, and other members can join the discussion to help resolve the disagreement and move forward. If members are habitually late, we will ask them to explain their situation to the other team members. If the situation becomes extreme, course staff will be notified. We will discuss as a team how to resolve situations in which any member has an excessive amount of outside work during a given week, so we can ensure that we hit our weekly deadlines as a group.
