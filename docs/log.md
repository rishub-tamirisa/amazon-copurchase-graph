# Weekly Development Log

## Week 1
***What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not?*** <br>
We set the goal of creating our initial classes for the project, specifically the templated graph data structure class. We have not yet completed this, as we were wawiting for our project proposal to be re-approved.

***What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week?*** <br>
We worked together to modify our leading question and explanation of the betweenness centrality implementation for our project. 

***What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals?*** <br>
None.

***What you plan to accomplish next week?*** <br>
We plan to finish what we initially intended on completing during Week 1, as well as complete the code that cleans, parses, and accesses our dataset.

## Week 2
***What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not?*** <br>
We set the goal of creating our templated graph data structure class. Due to multiple members of our team having multiple exams during the last week, we did not yet directly implement our graph data structure class. 

***What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week?*** <br>
While we did not yet physically create the graph data structure class, we internally discussed the specifics of our implementation so that we would be ready to make progress in the coming week. We have a solid idea of our how our implementation will work as well as the pseudocode for our intended algorithms, so we are confident that we will be able to make up our Week 1 and 2 objectives this week.

***What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals?*** <br>
None.

***What you plan to accomplish next week?*** <br>
We plan to finish what we initially intended on completing during Week 1 & 2, as well as write the betweenness centrality algorithm on the templated graph data structure class.

## Week 3
***What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not?*** <br>
We set the goal of finishing our week 1 and 2 goals, as well as writing the betweenness centrality algorithm on our graph ADT class. We accomplished all of our goals except the implementation of betweenness centrality calculation.

***What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week?*** <br>
We wrote an efficicent graph ADT class allowing for the insertion of vertices and edges into our graph, as well as the code for reading in our dataset. We also implemented our BFS traversal function, which returns the shortest path between two nodes in the graph, as our graph is unweighted and undirected. We also wrote test cases to ensure that this functionality works as expected and all of the test cases pass. 

***What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals?*** <br>
None. 

***What you plan to accomplish next week?*** <br>
We plan to finish our betweenness centrality algorithm and test cases, as well as start on our force-directed graph drawing functions. We also will add a few more helper functions in the graph ADT for removing nodes and edges.

## Week 4
***What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not?*** <br>
We set the goal of completing the betweenness centrality algorithm and starting the force-directed graph drawing functions. We have not yet finished implementing these algorithms.

***What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week?*** <br>
We discussed the implementation of the BC and FDG algorithms, and mainly talked about how we would implement these functions on a subset of our full graph.

***What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals?*** <br>
None.

***What you plan to accomplish next week?*** <br>
We plan to implement in code the BC algorithm and FDG algorithm on our `test.txt` dataset, and separately locate a subset of our dataset that is fully connected.
