# Weekly Development Log

## Week 1
**What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not?**
We set the goal of creating our initial classes for the project, specifically the templated graph data structure class. We have not yet completed this, as we were wawiting for our project proposal to be re-approved.
**What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week?**
We worked together to modify our leading question and explanation of the betweenness centrality implementation for our project. 
**What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals?**
None.
**What you plan to accomplish next week?**
We plan to finish what we initially intended on completing during Week 1, as well as complete the code that cleans, parses, and accesses our dataset.
