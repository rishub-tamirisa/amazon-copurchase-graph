# Weekly Development Log

## Week 1
***What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not?*** <br>
We set the goal of creating our initial classes for the project, specifically the templated graph data structure class. We have not yet completed this, as we were wawiting for our project proposal to be re-approved.

***What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week?*** <br>
We worked together to modify our leading question and explanation of the betweenness centrality implementation for our project. 

***What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals?*** <br>
None.

***What you plan to accomplish next week?*** <br>
We plan to finish what we initially intended on completing during Week 1, as well as complete the code that cleans, parses, and accesses our dataset.

## Week 2
***What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not?*** <br>
We set the goal of creating our templated graph data structure class. Due to multiple members of our team having multiple exams during the last week, we did not yet directly implement our graph data structure class. 

***What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week?*** <br>
While we did not yet physically create the graph data structure class, we internally discussed the specifics of our implementation so that we would be ready to make progress in the coming week. We have a solid idea of our how our implementation will work as well as the pseudocode for our intended algorithms, so we are confident that we will be able to make up our Week 1 and 2 objectives this week.

***What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals?*** <br>
None.

***What you plan to accomplish next week?*** <br>
We plan to finish what we initially intended on completing during Week 1 & 2, as well as write the betweenness centrality algorithm on the templated graph data structure class.
